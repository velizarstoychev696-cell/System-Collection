# Systems-Collection
This Repository will contain a sporatic collection of Systems built-from-scratch, and relying soly on the Standard C++17 Library.
Currently implemented Systems are:

1. A File Serializer - Used to Read & Write Data from/to Files, made Flexible, and easy to use, even with custom classes.

2. A Crafting Handler Class - Designed to be highly efficient in both memory & speed for both Grid & Non-Grid based Crafting, referred to as "Ordered" & "Unordered" in the code.

3. An Inventory System - Designed to be useable with or without the Crafting Class, this System allows for basic Inventory Management, Unique & General Item IDing, Stack Limiting and optional Metadata.

4. A Rhythm Chart Engine - Storing each Note in only 64 bits, capable handling Long Notes, Mines, Misses, Ghost Taps, Score Ranks, Bot-Play, and automatically keep track of the "Chord" Patterns.

5. A Time-Queue Container - Capable of handling any "Temporary Access Event", given a time window, by only allowing access to each element within its window of time.

More to come eventually.
